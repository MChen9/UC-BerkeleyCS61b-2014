1. The _heap_ stores all objects, including all arrays and all class variables(i.e. static variables)
  - Instance variables live in heap, inside the object they belong to

2. The _stack_ stores all local variables, including all parameters

3. Garbage Collection
  - Reference goes out of scope, permanently
  - Assign the reference to another object
  - Explicitly set the object to null
